	 * 
A Max Heap is a Complete Binary Tree. A Max heap is typically represented as an array. The root element will be at Arr[0]. Below table shows indexes of other nodes for the ith node, i.e., Arr[i]:
Arr[(i-1)/2] Returns the parent node.
Arr[(2*i)+1] Returns the left child node.
Arr[(2*i)+2] Returns the right child node.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
Operations on Max Heap:
1) getMax(): It returns the root element of Max Heap. Time Complexity of this operation is O(1).

2) extractMax(): Removes the maximum element from MaxHeap. Time Complexity of this Operation is O(Log n) as this operation needs to maintain the heap property (by calling heapify()) after removing root.

4) insert(): Inserting a new key takes O(Log n) time. We add a new key at the end of the tree. If new key is smaller than its parent, then we donâ€™t need to do anything. Otherwise, we need to traverse up to fix the violated heap property.
